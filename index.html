    <h3>Mandala Devine Art</h3>
    <p class="mandala-text">Mandala is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The circular designs symbolizes the idea that life is never ending and everything is connected.
      Mayans, Aztecs, Australian aborigines and European Catholics all created mandalas in one form or another, but mandalas are most common in Buddhist and Hindu art of the Indian subcontinent.
      Traditionally, a mandala is a geometric design or pattern that represents the cosmos or deities in various heavenly worlds.
      Mandalas, meaning "circles" in Sanskrit, are sacred symbols that are used for meditation, prayer, healing and art therapy for both adults and children. Mandalas have been shown in
      clinical studies to boost the immune system, reduce stress and pain, lower blood pressure, promote sleep and ease depression.</p>

    <h3>Painting</h3>
    <p class="painting-text">Painting is an important form in the visual arts, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture, narration, and abstraction.

      Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix" or "support").
      The medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.
      The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood, glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may
      incorporate multiple other materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects.</p>

    <h3>Digital Art</h3>
    <p class="digital-art-text">
      Digital art is the result ofÂ continually evolving technology.Digital art isÂ work made with digital technology or presented on digital technology. This includes images done completely on computer or hand-drawn images scanned into a computer and
      finished using a software program like Adobe Illustrator. ... Some digital art involves manipulation of video images.Digital painting is a new medium that lets us create beautiful artwork, without the messiness of painting with inks or oils. It
      still requires many of the same skills and techniques as traditional painting (no, you canâ€™t just create art at the click of a buttonâ€¦ yet), but itâ€™s also easier in many ways.

      Some popular digital art platforms are
      1.Procreate.( for ios)
      2.Adobe Photoshop Sketch. â€¦(windows)
      3.Adobe Illustrator Draw. â€¦(windows)
      4.Clip Studio Paintâ€¦..(android and windows)
      5.Inspire Pro. â€¦(windows)
      6.Ibix paintâ€¦..(android and windows)</p>

    <h3>Sketch Art</h3>
    <p class="sketch-art-text">Sketch is traditionally a rough drawing or painting in which an artist notes down his preliminary ideas for a work that will eventually be realized with greater precision and detail. The term also applies to brief
      creative pieces that per se may have artistic merit.In a traditional sketch, the emphasis usually is laid on the general design and composition of the work and on overall feeling.


      There are three main types of functional sketches.
      ðŸ”¸The first type is known as a croquis.

      ðŸ”¸The second type is pochade.

      ðŸ”¸The third type is portraiture</p>

      <p class="p1-text">Hi, I'm Swastika Ray am from Kiit University, am a 2nd year b.tech student from Computer Science and Engineering branch and head Coordinator of Art Department of In4mals Society .
        While framing my educational career I am trying to improve my artistic skills . Art has always been a part of my life and colours and illustrations never failed to attract me but the pandemic gave an opportunity to focus more towards
        improving my skills and creating a better piece of art with each passing day .
        I am not a trained artist and have always practiced to learn from my mistakes . Unfortunately I have never participated in any contest so am left with no prizes or medal to certify my talent but indeed am blessed with the love and support of
        several people who actually motivate me to learn more and go on creating magic with my every stroke .
        Basically am a mandala artist ,patience and hardwork is the key behind my improvement . I feel every stroke of my fineliners and a prefect execution always pleases me but surely am planning to train myself more and more to bring the best out
        of me and fill up the empty sketch books with my developing creativity

      <p class="p2-text">Hi, I'm Ananya Das! I've been painting since I was 4. Colours fascinate me a lot and the thought that I can create something however I want to with all my imagination gave rise to my obsession regarding painting. At the
        beginning I was mostly into sketching and painting, but with time I also started doodling. Recently I have started working on digital illustrations and artworks. Since my childhood I have attended various drawing competitions and it played a
        major role in my growth in this field.</p>

      <p class="p3-text">I'm Rishi Singh,19 from Kolkata West Bengal. Being a b.tech student I hardly get time to peruse with my passion .I start my drawing career nearly 12 years ago around 2009 when I was just 7. I was the youngest in the class but
        yet got the support of all the class mates .Since then I started participating in all the art competition. I hardly thought about winning, for me participating was important but end up winning of occupying some position..I completed my
        diploma in fine arts from a renowned art institution in kolkata.It took me 11 years to do so.After completion of my diploma I thought of starting digital art at first I started drawing on my mother's phone but later on my father gifted me an
        ipad I learnt digital sketches by going through the tutorials present on the youtube..Now I draw on 'Clip Studion Paint' also knows as csp I have a speciality of drawing portraits and human figures. I am also trying to go for the deep
        learning of these digital art platforms to excel more. Instagram - "_soul__orb"</p>

      <p class="p4-text">Myself Abhinandan Sarkar, hailing from Hooghly, West Bengal. I did my schooling from Pearls of God, Hooghly. My interest is in the world of Art, Design and Culture. I completed upto 6th year of diploma in art through Bangiya
        Sangeet Parishad and Suro Bharati Sangeet Kala Kendra ,
        recently studying in KIIT University.
        My ambition is to work with such industries or in such platform where I can use my passion or knack to make my thoughts applicable in real life. Bounding myself only in painting field is not what I desire. I desire to explore the vast field
        of Art. My hobbies include painting, photography, calligraphy, exploring my true self, etc. I wish to learn innovative design thinking/designing process, Films and its making, cinematography,etc. My honesty to myself and my works, has brought
        me some achievements and wish to achieve more heights. I must admit that Iâ€™m greatly Inspired by late Satyajit Ray and his works, which are guiding me throughout my life.</p>
